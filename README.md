# Buds
Buds is a customizable platform for the study-er to curate their virtual environment to what fits them best. 
Study-ers are welcomed to their individualized study session by prompts to select their current mood, and flower.
Buds offers the option to select nature sounds once studying with a buddy. The buddy’s time of day will sync with the study-er’s time of day.
